                Hey there! I’m Subhradip, a successful code copier who spends more time
                Googling “how to fix my code” than actually coding. I juggle React, and
                Next.js, Tailwind CSS while pretending to be a tech genius. Check out my
                projects, or don’t—I’ll be here, sipping coffee and waiting for
                inspiration (or a snack).
